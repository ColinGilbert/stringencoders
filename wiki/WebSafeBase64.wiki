For URLs and form-posts the mime type of `www-form-urlencoded` is used and
defines certain transformations:

 * The `+` may be decoded as a space ' '
 * The `/` will be encoded with `%2f`
 * The `=` may be encoded with `%3d`
 * While `.`, `-`, `*` and `_` are safe and not touched.

While using `.` in the spec if safe, some proxies and servers may
misinterpret this as a filename reference (this is not so common anymore in 2007). Likewise I've seen some implementations use a tilde `~`, but again this is a special character used in user directory mappings and is not safe according to spec.
 
Therefore in this modified alphabet defined in this class:

 * `+` --> `-` (char 62, plus to dash)
 * `/` --> `_` (char 63, slash to underscore)
 * `=` --> `*` padding

makes the base64 encoding safe for inclusion into urls.

You can change this.  The default is the equivalent of

{{{
./configure --with-b64w-chars='-_\*'
}}}

Other popular variations are

{{{
./configure --with-b64w-chars='-_.'
./configure --with-b64w-chars='_-.'
}}}

If you are integrating with a thirdparty source, *be sure to check with them on the alphabet*.  If you only create and process the urls, the default is fine.


This only changes the `modp_b64w` (with `w`) functions.  The `modp_b64` is unchanged and is always standard non-websafe urls.
